- 👋 Hi, I’m Max Yankov aka golergka.
- 👀 I’m a digital nomad. I work as a fullstack developer at [Deep Channel](http://deepchannel.com).
- 🌱 I have many unfinished lazy pet projects in the backlog. One I'm currently working on is [rs-lox](https://github.com/golergka/rs-lox). It's Lox programming language from the book Crafting Interpreters, implemented in Rust.
- 💞️ I also write music and DJ. I've spent a lot of years working in gamedev in the past and dabbled in political activism in Russia (when it was still possible).
- 📫 Best way to reach me is on Telegram: [@golergka](http://t.me/golergka)
