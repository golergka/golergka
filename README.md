- 👋 Hi, I’m Max Yankov aka **golergka**.
- 👀 I’m a digital nomad and a full-stack developer. Game development, client-side web, server-side web, native app development, you name it — I've probably worked with it.
- 🌱 [Full list of my toy projects and repositories](my-repositories.md).
- 💞️ I also write music and DJ. I've spent a lot of years working in gamedev in the past and dabbled in political activism in Russia (when it was still possible).
- 📫 Best way to reach me is on Telegram: [@golergka](http://t.me/golergka)
